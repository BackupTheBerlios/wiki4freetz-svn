==Welcome to !CiWiki alias !DidiWiki 
/!CiWiki / is a fork of /!DidiWiki / with several new features added. 
CiWiki is a small and simple [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki WikiWikiWeb] implementation 
Ideal for personal note-taking, to do lists, and any other uses you can think of. 
CiWiki is fast and does not require webserver, database mng and php interpreter. 
For an example of how a !CiWiki entry looks in text form you can [?edit edit] this page. Also see WikiHelp for infomation on usage and formatting rules. Use The WikiSandbox to experiment.
